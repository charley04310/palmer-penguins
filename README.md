## Project structure

1. **R Markdown (Rmd) file:** This file contains the R code to load and analyze the data from the palmerpenguins library. It performs various statistical experiments such as analyzing the dimensions of penguin wings and beaks, exploring correlations between variables, and creating visualizations to depict the results.

2. **Shiny application:** The Shiny application is designed to provide a static user interface for exploring penguin data and visualizing the results of statistical analyses.
